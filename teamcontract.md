## Team Contract for ICS 314 final project Manoa Bird Watch by Ace Reyes, Jeffrey Jian, Alana Wesly, and Chayanika Devi

## Meetings and Communication
We will meet every ICS 314 section 2 class period. We will communicate through our discord channel, and will cooridnate additional meetings on campus or discord call as needed. If any team member is unable to attend they must inform the other team members, and the other team members will update them on what they missed. Team members will update the team on the status of their issues as progress is made.

## Decision Making
Decisions will be made to follow the requirements of the final project. Team members may take initiative to do their own work on the project, but there must be agreement on who will work on what aspect of the proect and the design of the application. If there is any conflict or the team is unable to come to a consensus, we may consult our professor Brook Conner. 

## Work Flow
We will continously use issue driven project management, by planning what our tasks are and who will do them with issues. We will consistently work on our project, and aim to complete all the requirements on time.
